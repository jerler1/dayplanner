#### **Installation**
---
To intall this application using prebuilt html and css elements involved this:

1. Constructed the first row in html, to verify the look was what I wanted. 
1. Installed the day.JS CDN and read up on documentation.
1. Developed a for loop to dynamically make all rows of the calender, using approiate classes for the css, and using said css classes a color scheme was installed to show if an hour has passed or is upcoming.
1. Configured the buttons to save the notes in the text input to be saved into local data.
1. Reconfigued the for loop to get the local data as it is being populated.


#### **Trials**
---
The under lying principles of this task were on the more simple side, but learning to read the documentation and implement a JavaScript libraray was refreshing and rewarding.

#### **Usage**
---
The usage of this site is very simple.  In the text area in the middle of the page, you can type any notations you wish and click the save button on the right side of the row that is corresponding to the text input you are writing in.  Once clicked the text will be saved and when the application is reloaded the text will still be present.
